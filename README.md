# Getting Started

Any IDE or Text Editor that supports CMake Projects (and vcpkg) should work for developing the project.

## Building

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Brewing-Team/Coffee-Engine.git
cd Coffee-Engine
```

### 2. Compilation
<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>
There are a lot of ways to do it. From installing all the necessary packages for building it (cmake, vcpkg, a compiler...), to using a IDE environment. My recomendation is to use an IDE environment if what you want is an straightforward way to compile the project.

#### Instructions to compile the project using an IDE

##### Visual Studio 2022
1. Open the folder with Visual Studio 2022
2. Enable vcpkg integration. More info at https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/vcpkg-is-now-included-with-visual-studio.
3. Reconfigure the cmake project. If the output panel display something like ```running vcpkg install``` then you are ready to go to the next stage.
4. Wait until all the dependencies are installed by vcpkg.
Then select on the top play button the Coffee-Editor.exe and run it.
5. Go to the "bin/Coffee-Engine/<build type>" folder
6. Congratulations! You have built Coffee-Engine for the first time!

##### CLion
1. Open the folder with CLion
2. ...
    
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Linux</summary>

#### 1. Install vcpkg

##### Clone vcpkg
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
```
##### Run the bootstrap
```
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
```

##### Enable the vcpkg instance
```
./vcpkg integrate install
```
> Sometimes this will not automatically add the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable!

##### For more info take a look at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-powershell

#### 2. Build
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j $(nproc) CoffeeEditor
```
#### 3. Enjoy!
```
cd ../bin/CoffeeEditor/Release
./CoffeeEditor
```
</details>
